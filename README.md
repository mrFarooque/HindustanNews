# Hindustan Times

# About

#### It's a clone of NEWS website called Hindustan Times based in India. Our team built it as our unit-3 Project for Masai School contruction week. The flow of the project was to make it as function as we could therefore adding the functionalities like multi-user sign-in/sign-out, search feature and navigation and many more. Though the website is completed as is functional but due to the API providers changing the policies, the website cannot fetch the API data outside local host and so we recommend to extract our repository and host it on your own server.
